# Abstract
The World's Easiest Platformer is a perfectly ordinary platformer… probably. Like the name says, it's the easiest platformer you will ever play. It has levels, platforms, a jump button, all the usual stuff you would expect. There's absolutely nothing weird about this game, and this abstract would never ever lie to you about that. Ever. Probably.

Run and jump around as a business man in a suit as you play through 10 very normal levels, none of which will do anything unexpected. We definitely did not spend a godawful amount of time setting traps in the levels that would read you like a book. Like making disappearing platforms. Or reversing gravity. Or make you play Flappy Bird... probably.

We're not jerks though, so progress will be automatically saved when you complete a level, in case you need to take a break from ~~the rage induced by our traps~~ the overwhelming awesomeness of these levels! We also have sprites, sounds effects, and background music to ~~taunt you while you suffer~~ enhance your experience! Probably. If you don't like pixel art or 8-bit style music and sounds, we're sorry for your bad tastes.

Basically, please play our game. We guarantee you'll have a ~~miserable~~ great experience!
